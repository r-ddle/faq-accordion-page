## My process

I started creating the structure by using HTML and then desigining the site with CSS. I did not know any JS and am still learning so I searched on google and also used AI to get help for that part.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS

### What I learned

I learnt about EventListerners and a bit of JS

```js
addEventListener("click", () => {}
```

### Continued development

Going to focus on JS and learn how to add a smooth transition for the svg transformation when clicking the icon to reveal the answers
